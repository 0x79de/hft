# Building Ultra-Fast HFT Trading System in Rust with Claude

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for rewriting the entire HFT (High-Frequency Trading) order book system from C++ to Rust using Claude AI assistance. The goal is to maintain all existing features while leveraging Rust's safety, performance, and modern language features.

## Claude Prompting Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Architecture Setup

```text
Create a high-performance HFT trading system in Rust with the following requirements:
- Ultra-low latency order matching engine
- Lock-free data structures for order book
- Multi-threaded event processing
- Real-time market data streaming
- Advanced latency profiling
- Memory-efficient price level management
- Cross-platform compatibility

Set up the basic project structure with Cargo.toml dependencies for:
- Async runtime (tokio)
- Serialization (serde)
- Lock-free collections (crossbeam)
- Fast hashmaps (dashmap)
- High-performance allocator (mimalloc)
- Logging and metrics
```

### Phase 2: Core Data Structures
```
Design Rust data structures for HFT trading system:
1. Fixed-point Price type for deterministic arithmetic
2. Order struct with all necessary fields
3. Trade execution records
4. Market data snapshots
5. OrderId with atomic generation
6. Side enum for bid/ask

Implement these with:
- Zero-copy serialization where possible
- Memory layout optimization
- SIMD-friendly alignment
- Cache-efficient data access patterns
```

### Phase 3: Lock-Free Order Book Implementation
```
Create a high-performance order book using:
- SkipMap for price levels (O(log n) operations)
- Lock-free algorithms for concurrent access
- FIFO order matching within price levels
- Efficient best bid/ask tracking
- Real-time market depth calculation
- Memory-efficient order storage

The order book should handle:
- 1M+ orders per second
- Sub-microsecond matching latency
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Dynamic price level management
```

### Phase 4: Event Processing System
```
Design an event-driven architecture with:
- MPMC channels for order events
- Batched processing for high throughput
- Priority queues for urgent orders
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Backpressure handling
- Circuit breaker patterns

Events to handle:
- Add Order
- Cancel Order
- Modify Order
- Market Data Updates
- Trade Executions
- System Status Changes
```

### Phase 5: Advanced Latency Profiler
```
Build a comprehensive latency measurement system:
- Nanosecond precision timing
- Per-operation statistics (min, max, avg, percentiles)
- Real-time metrics collection
- CSV/JSON export capabilities
- Histogram generation
- Performance regression detection
- Memory allocation tracking
- CPU utilization monitoring
```

### Phase 6: Trading Engine Core
```
Implement the main trading engine with:
- Multi-symbol support
- Risk management integration
- Position tracking
- Portfolio limits enforcement
- Auto-trading capabilities
- State management (start/stop/pause)
- Configuration hot-reload
- Graceful shutdown handling
```

### Phase 7: Benchmarking Framework
```
Create comprehensive benchmarks for:
- Order processing throughput
- Latency percentiles under load
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization efficiency
- Concurrent access performance
- Market data processing speed
- End-to-end system latency
- Stress testing scenarios
```

### Phase 8: Integration & Testing
```
Develop testing infrastructure:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Property-based testing
- Fuzzing for edge cases
- Performance regression tests
- Memory leak detection
- Thread safety validation
- Benchmark comparisons with C++ version
```

## Incremental Development Approach

### Step 1: Foundation

Ask Claude to create:

```promt
"Set up the basic Rust project structure for HFT trading system with proper Cargo.toml dependencies, workspace organization, and build configuration for maximum performance."
```

### Step 2: Core Types

```promt
"Implement the core trading data types in Rust: Price (fixed-point), Order, Trade, OrderId, Side enum, and MarketData with proper serialization and memory layout optimization."
```

### Step 3: Order Book Engine

```promt
"Create a lock-free order book implementation using crossbeam SkipMap with FIFO matching, efficient price level management, and real-time best bid/ask tracking."
```

### Step 4: Event Processing

```promt
"Design an event-driven order processing system with MPMC channels, batch processing capabilities, and backpressure handling for high-throughput trading."
```

### Step 5: Latency Measurement

```promt
"Build a comprehensive latency profiler with nanosecond precision, percentile calculations, real-time metrics collection, and export capabilities."
```

### Step 6: Trading Engine

```promt
"Implement the main trading engine with multi-symbol support, risk management, state management, and configuration handling."
```

### Step 7: Benchmarks

```promt
"Create a complete benchmarking suite that measures throughput, latency, memory usage, and compares performance with the original C++ implementation."
```

### Step 8: Integration

```promt
"Develop comprehensive tests, integration points, and deployment configurations for the complete HFT trading system."
```
